I have the following copilot agents available to help me refactor code:

.github/agents/conductor.agent.md
.github/agents/critic.agent.md
.github/agents/planner.agent.md
.github/agents/refactorer.agent.md
.github/agents/tester.agent.md

Add to the corresponding agent the following information:

- Make sure the refactor include golang best practices and design patterns and Golang idiomatic SOLID principles
- Ensure if a function is too long, it should be broken down into smaller functions to improve readability and maintainability.

- ensure that the code follows the [Uber Go Style Guide](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md)

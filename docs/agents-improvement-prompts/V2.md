I have the following copilot agents available to help me refactor code:

.github/agents/conductor.agent.md
.github/agents/critic.agent.md
.github/agents/planner.agent.md
.github/agents/refactorer.agent.md
.github/agents/tester.agent.md

Add to the corresponding agent the following information:

should make sure that all the tests are passing after the refactor and have more than 80% code coverage (best effort) and no less than 60% coverage at minimum.

also make sure to run the tests after the refactor to ensure that everything is working as expected and after the refactor make sure to run  golangci-lint run and fix any linting issues that may arise from the refactor.

This workflow should be with the goal to refactor any Go codebase to improve its readability, maintainability, and performance while ensuring that all tests are passing and that the code adheres to best practices and coding standards.
